Challenge Folders
================
This is the default location for all the challenge configurations for the CTF.

Each folder in this represents a different category of problems, with each
categories individual questions being specified in the directories
`problems.json`

We've included an `example` category to show how these questions work. Be sure
to REMOVE THIS DIRECTORY before the start of the CTF, unless you really like
unsolveable CTF questions (or I guess very easily solvable since those flags
are open source).
